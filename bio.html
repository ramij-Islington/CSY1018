    <h3>My Education Qualifications</h3>
      <p>Since my education had started in Singapore and continued in Canada, 
      it had always been enriched by the exposure to different cultures. <br>
      For example, when I was doing my O levels exam in Singapore, I had to write
       essays about social issues locally and globally in U.K. like the NHS.
        And these essays were sent by courier to literature department of 
        Cambridge University for evaluation. When I was in the International 
        Baccalaureate(IB) diploma tech immersion program from grade 8 to 9 in Canada,
         I had taught myself how to design animation films and posters. Then my 
         interest jumped to coding for gaming. At Nami, I have learnt how to code Java in 
        Greenfoot. We designed a dynamic webpage with CSS3 and Html. We had to also make documentation
        of our end product.<br>
